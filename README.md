## Course 1: Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow:

### Week 1:

  Functional APIs

  Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!

### Week 2:

  Custom Loss Functions

  Loss functions help measure how well a model is doing, and are used to help a neural network learn from the training data. Learn how to build custom loss functions, including the contrastive loss function that is used in a Siamese network.

### Week 3:

  Custom Layers

  Custom layers give you the flexibility to implement models that use non-standard layers. Practice building off of existing standard layers to create custom layers for your models.

  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.%20%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%203)
### Week 4:

  Custom Models

  You can build off of existing models to add custom functionality. This week, extend the TensorFlow Model Class to build a ResNet model!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.%20%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%204)

### Week 5:

  Bonus Content - Callbacks

  Custom callbacks allow you to customize what your model outputs or how it behaves during training. This week, implement a custom callback to stop training once the callback detects overfitting.

  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.%20%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%205)

## Course 2: Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow

### Week 1

  Differentiation and Gradients

  This week, you will get a detailed look at the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow - tensor objects. For example, you will be able to describe the difference between eager mode and graph mode in TensorFlow, and explain why eager mode is very user friendly for you as a developer. You will also use TensorFlow tools to calculate gradients so that you don’t have to look for your old calculus textbooks next time you need to get a gradient!

### Week 2

  Custom Training

  This week, you will build custom training loops using GradientTape and TensorFlow Datasets. Being able to write your own training loops will give you more flexibility and visibility with your model training. You will also use a function to calculate the derivatives of functions so that you don’t have to look to your old calculus textbooks to calculate gradients.

  [Examples and Assigment here](./2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%202)

### Week 3

  Graph Mode

  This week, you’ll learn about the benefits of generating code that runs in “graph mode”. You’ll take a peek at what graph code looks like, and you’ll practice generating this more efficient code automatically with TensorFlow’s tools, so that you don’t have to write the graph code yourself!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%203)

### Week 4

  Distributed Training

  This week, you will harness the power of distributed training to process more data and train larger models, faster. You’ll get an overview of various distributed training strategies and then practice working with two strategies, one that trains on multiple GPU cores, and the other that trains on multiple TPU cores. Get your cape ready, because you’re going to get some superpowers this week!
