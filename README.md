## Course 1: Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow:

### Week 1:

  Functional APIs

  Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!
  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.  Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow/Week 1)

### Week 2:

  Custom Loss Functions

  Loss functions help measure how well a model is doing, and are used to help a neural network learn from the training data. Learn how to build custom loss functions, including the contrastive loss function that is used in a Siamese network.
  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.  Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow/Week 2)

### Week 3:

  Custom Layers

  Custom layers give you the flexibility to implement models that use non-standard layers. Practice building off of existing standard layers to create custom layers for your models.
  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.  Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow/Week 3)
### Week 4:

  Custom Models

  You can build off of existing models to add custom functionality. This week, extend the TensorFlow Model Class to build a ResNet model!
  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.  Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow/Week 4)

### Week 5:

  Bonus Content - Callbacks

  Custom callbacks allow you to customize what your model outputs or how it behaves during training. This week, implement a custom callback to stop training once the callback detects overfitting.
