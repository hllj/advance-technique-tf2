## Course 1: Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow:

### Week 1:

  Functional APIs

  Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.%20%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%201)

### Week 2:

  Custom Loss Functions

  Loss functions help measure how well a model is doing, and are used to help a neural network learn from the training data. Learn how to build custom loss functions, including the contrastive loss function that is used in a Siamese network.

  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.%20%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%202)

### Week 3:

  Custom Layers

  Custom layers give you the flexibility to implement models that use non-standard layers. Practice building off of existing standard layers to create custom layers for your models.

  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.%20%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%203)
### Week 4:

  Custom Models

  You can build off of existing models to add custom functionality. This week, extend the TensorFlow Model Class to build a ResNet model!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.%20%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%204)

### Week 5:

  Bonus Content - Callbacks

  Custom callbacks allow you to customize what your model outputs or how it behaves during training. This week, implement a custom callback to stop training once the callback detects overfitting.

  [Examples and Assigment here](./1.%20%20Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%205)

## Course 2: Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow

### Week 1

  Differentiation and Gradients

  This week, you will get a detailed look at the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow - tensor objects. For example, you will be able to describe the difference between eager mode and graph mode in TensorFlow, and explain why eager mode is very user friendly for you as a developer. You will also use TensorFlow tools to calculate gradients so that you don’t have to look for your old calculus textbooks next time you need to get a gradient!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%201)

### Week 2

  Custom Training

  This week, you will build custom training loops using GradientTape and TensorFlow Datasets. Being able to write your own training loops will give you more flexibility and visibility with your model training. You will also use a function to calculate the derivatives of functions so that you don’t have to look to your old calculus textbooks to calculate gradients.

  [Examples and Assigment here](./2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%202)

### Week 3

  Graph Mode

  This week, you’ll learn about the benefits of generating code that runs in “graph mode”. You’ll take a peek at what graph code looks like, and you’ll practice generating this more efficient code automatically with TensorFlow’s tools, so that you don’t have to write the graph code yourself!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%203)

### Week 4

  Distributed Training

  This week, you will harness the power of distributed training to process more data and train larger models, faster. You’ll get an overview of various distributed training strategies and then practice working with two strategies, one that trains on multiple GPU cores, and the other that trains on multiple TPU cores. Get your cape ready, because you’re going to get some superpowers this week!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./2.%20Custom%20and%20Distributed%20Training%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%204)


## Course 3: Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow

### Week 1

  Introduction to Computer Vision

  Get a conceptual overview of image classification, object localization, object detection, and image segmentation. Also be able to describe multi-label classification, and distinguish between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. In the rest of this course, you will apply TensorFlow to build object detection and image segmentation models.

  [Examples and Assigment here](./3.Advanced%20Computer%20Vision%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%201)

### Week 2
  Object Detection

  This week, you’ll get an overview of some popular object detection models, such as regional-CNN and ResNet-50. You’ll use object detection models that you’ll retrieve from TensorFlow Hub, download your own models and configure them for training, and also build your own models for object detection. By using transfer learning, you will train a model to detect and localize rubber duckies using just five training examples. You’ll also get to manually label your own rubber ducky images!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./3.Advanced%20Computer%20Vision%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%202)

### Week 3
  Image Segmentation

  This week is all about image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional neural network. With these networks, you can assign class labels to each pixel, and perform much more detailed identification of objects compared to bounding boxes. You’ll build the fully convolutional neural network, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN this week to identify and detect numbers, pets, and even zombies!

  [Examples and Assigment here](./3.Advanced%20Computer%20Vision%20with%20TensorFlow/Week%203)

### Week 4
  Visualization and Interpretability

  This week, you’ll learn about the importance of model interpretability, which is the understanding of how your model arrives at its decisions. You’ll also implement class activation maps, saliency maps, and gradient-weighted class activation maps to identify which parts of an image are being used by your model to make its predictions. You’ll also see an example of how visualizing a model’s intermediate layer activations can help to improve the design of a famous network, AlexNet.
