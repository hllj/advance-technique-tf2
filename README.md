## Course 1: Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow:

### Week 1:

  Functional APIs

  Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!

### Week 2:

  Custom Loss Functions

  Loss functions help measure how well a model is doing, and are used to help a neural network learn from the training data. Learn how to build custom loss functions, including the contrastive loss function that is used in a Siamese network.

### Week 3:

  Custom Layers

  Custom layers give you the flexibility to implement models that use non-standard layers. Practice building off of existing standard layers to create custom layers for your models.

### Week 4:

  Custom Models

  You can build off of existing models to add custom functionality. This week, extend the TensorFlow Model Class to build a ResNet model!

### Week 5:

  Bonus Content - Callbacks

  Custom callbacks allow you to customize what your model outputs or how it behaves during training. This week, implement a custom callback to stop training once the callback detects overfitting.
